# Flextask

Flextask is an extension for the [Clava](https://github.com/specs-feup/clava) C/C++ to C/C++ Source-to-source compiler that creates a task graph for any generic C/C++ application. These task graphs are automatically analyzed and characterized by several metrics, and through a highly flexible granularity mechanism we can perform extensive graph operations, such as task merging, splitting and clustering, while always outputting valid and readable C/C++ source code.
